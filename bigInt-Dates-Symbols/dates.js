// use the data object in JS to get the current date and time. 
// use the date objects functions to get all the details

var dateAndTime = new Date();
console.log(dateAndTime);
console.log(dateAndTime.getTime()); // gives you EPOC time
// EPOC time is the number of seconds 00:00:00 that has passed from UTC from 1970, used for logging and systems to understand when in time this happened


//TODO ->  explore and play around with some functions of the Date object
